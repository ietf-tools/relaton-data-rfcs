abstract:
- content: "<p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains registries
    to track code points used by protocols such as those defined by the IETF and documented
    in RFCs developed on the IETF Stream.</p><p>The Independent Submission Stream
    is another source of documents that can be published as RFCs. This stream is under
    the care of the Independent Submissions Editor (ISE).</p><p>This document complements
    RFC 4846 by providing a description of how the ISE currently handles documents
    in the Independent Submission Stream that request actions from IANA. Nothing in
    this document changes existing IANA registries or their allocation policies, nor
    does it change any previously documented processes.</p>"
