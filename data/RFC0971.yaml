abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC is a comparison of several data representation standards that
    are currently in use. The standards discussed are the CCITT X.409 recommendation,
    the NBS Computer Based Message System (CBMS) standard, DARPA Multimedia Mail system,
    the Courier remote procedure call protocol, and the SUN Remote Procedure Call
    package. No proposals in this document are intended as standards for the ARPA-Internet
    at this time. Rather, it is hoped that a general consensus will emerge as to the
    appropriate approach to a data representation standard, leading eventually to
    the adoption of an ARPA-Internet standard.</p>"
