abstract:
- content: '<p>This RFC defines a proposed standard protocol to support NetBIOS services
    in a TCP/IP environment. Both local network and internet operation are supported.
    Various node types are defined to accommodate local and internet topologies and
    to allow operation with or without the use of IP broadcast. This RFC gives the
    detailed specifications of the netBIOS-over-TCP packets, protocols, and defined
    constants and variables. A more general overview is found in a companion RFC,
    "Protocol Standard For NetBIOS Service on TCP/UDP Transport: Concepts and Methods".</p>'
