abstract:
- content: "<p>The Multicast VPN (MVPN) specifications allow a single Point-to-Multipoint
    (P2MP) tunnel to carry traffic of multiple IP VPNs (referred to as VPNs in this
    document). The EVPN specifications allow a single P2MP tunnel to carry traffic
    of multiple Broadcast Domains (BDs). These features require the ingress router
    of the P2MP tunnel to allocate an upstream-assigned MPLS label for each VPN or
    for each BD. A packet sent on a P2MP tunnel then carries the label that is mapped
    to its VPN or BD (in some cases, a distinct upstream-assigned label is needed
    for each flow.) Since each ingress router allocates labels independently, with
    no coordination among the ingress routers, the egress routers may need to keep
    track of a large number of labels. The number of labels may need to be as large
    as, or larger than, the product of the number of ingress routers times the number
    of VPNs or BDs. However, the number of labels can be greatly reduced if the association
    between a label and a VPN or BD is made by provisioning, so that all ingress routers
    assign the same label to a particular VPN or BD. New procedures are needed in
    order to take advantage of such provisioned labels. These new procedures also
    apply to Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) tunnels. This document updates RFCs
    6514, 7432, and 7582 by specifying the necessary procedures.</p>"
