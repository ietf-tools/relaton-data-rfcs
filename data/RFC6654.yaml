abstract:
- content: <p>This document proposes an alternative IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4
    Infrastructures (6rd) deployment model to that of RFC 5969. The basic 6rd model
    allows IPv6 hosts to gain access to IPv6 networks across an IPv4 access network
    using 6-in-4 tunnels. 6rd requires support by a device (the 6rd customer edge,
    or 6rd-CE) on the customer site, which must also be assigned an IPv4 address.
    The alternative model described in this document initiates the 6-in-4 tunnels
    from an operator-owned Gateway collocated with the operator's IPv4 network edge
    rather than from customer equipment, and hence is termed "Gateway-initiated 6rd"
    (GI 6rd). The advantages of this approach are that it requires no modification
    to customer equipment and avoids assignment of IPv4 addresses to customer equipment.
    The latter point means less pressure on IPv4 addresses in a high-growth environment.
    This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.</p>
