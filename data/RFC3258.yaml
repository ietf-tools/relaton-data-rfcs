abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a set of practices intended to enable an authoritative
    name server operator to provide access to a single named server in multiple locations.
    The primary motivation for the development and deployment of these practices is
    to increase the distribution of Domain Name System (DNS) servers to previously
    under- served areas of the network topology and to reduce the latency for DNS
    query responses in those areas. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
