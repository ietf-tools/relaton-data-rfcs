abstract:
- content: <p>The Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) specifications apply web
    technologies to constrained environments. One such important technology is Web
    Linking (RFC 8288), which CoRE specifications use as the basis for a number of
    discovery protocols, such as the Link Format (RFC 6690) in the Constrained Application
    Protocol's (CoAP's) resource discovery process (Section 7.2 of RFC 7252) and the
    Resource Directory (RD) (RFC 9176).</p><p>Web Links can have target attributes,
    the names of which are not generally coordinated by the Web Linking specification
    (Section 2.2 of RFC 8288). This document introduces an IANA registry for coordinating
    names of target attributes when used in CoRE. It updates the "RD Parameters" IANA
    registry created by RFC 9176 to coordinate with this registry.</p>
