abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a new report block type within the framework
    of RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports (XRs). One of the initial XR report
    block types is the Loss Run Length Encoding (RLE) Report Block. This report conveys
    information regarding the individual Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) packet
    receipt and loss events experienced during the RTCP interval preceding the transmission
    of the report. The new report, which is referred to as the Post-repair Loss RLE
    report, carries information regarding the packets that remain lost after all loss-repair
    methods are applied. By comparing the RTP packet receipts/losses before and after
    the loss repair is completed, one can determine the effectiveness of the loss-
    repair methods in an aggregated fashion. This document also defines the signaling
    of the Post-repair Loss RLE report in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).
