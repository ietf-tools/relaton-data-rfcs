abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo intends to provide a complete discussion of the protocols
    and techniques used to embed DoD standard Internet Protocol datagrams (and its
    associated higher level protocols) on Network Systems Corporation's HYPERchannel
    equipment.  This document is directed toward network planners and implementors
    who are already familiar with the TCP/IP protocol suite and the techniques used
    to carry TCP/IP traffic on common networks such as the DDN or the Ethernet.  No
    great familiarity with NSC products is assumed; an appendix is devoted to a review
    of NSC technologies and protocols.</p>"
