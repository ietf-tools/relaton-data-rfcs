abstract:
- content: "<p>This document obsoletes RFC 2960 and RFC 3309. It describes the Stream
    Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). SCTP is designed to transport Public Switched
    Telephone Network (PSTN) signaling messages over IP networks, but is capable of
    broader applications.</p><p>SCTP is a reliable transport protocol operating on
    top of a connectionless packet network such as IP. It offers the following services
    to its users:</p><p>-- acknowledged error-free non-duplicated transfer of user
    data,</p><p>-- data fragmentation to conform to discovered path MTU size,</p><p>--
    sequenced delivery of user messages within multiple streams, with an option for
    order-of-arrival delivery of individual user messages,</p><p>-- optional bundling
    of multiple user messages into a single SCTP packet, and</p><p>-- network-level
    fault tolerance through supporting of multi-homing at either or both ends of an
    association.</p><p>The design of SCTP includes appropriate congestion avoidance
    behavior and resistance to flooding and masquerade attacks. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
