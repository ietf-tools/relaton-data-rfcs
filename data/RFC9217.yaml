abstract:
- content: '<p>In contrast to the present Internet architecture, a path-aware internetworking
    architecture has two important properties: it exposes the properties of available
    Internet paths to endpoints, and it provides for endpoints and applications to
    use these properties to select paths through the Internet for their traffic. While
    this property of "path awareness" already exists in many Internet-connected networks
    within single domains and via administrative interfaces to the network layer,
    a fully path-aware internetwork expands these concepts across layers and across
    the Internet.</p><p>This document poses questions in path-aware networking, open
    as of 2021, that must be answered in the design, development, and deployment of
    path-aware internetworks. It was originally written to frame discussions in the
    Path Aware Networking Research Group (PANRG), and has been published to snapshot
    current thinking in this space.</p>'
