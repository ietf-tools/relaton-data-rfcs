abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents security-related requirements for the Interface
    to the Routing System (I2RS) protocol, which provides a new interface to the routing
    system described in the I2RS architecture document (RFC 7921). The I2RS protocol
    is implemented by reusing portions of existing IETF protocols and adding new features
    to them. One such reuse is of the security features of a secure transport (e.g.,
    Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure SHell (SSH) Protocol, Datagram TLS (DTLS))
    such as encryption, message integrity, mutual peer authentication, and anti-replay
    protection. The new I2RS features to consider from a security perspective are
    as follows: a priority mechanism to handle multi-headed write transactions, an
    opaque secondary identifier that identifies an application using the I2RS client,
    and an extremely constrained read-only non-secure transport.</p>"
