abstract:
- content: 'The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS record allows a domain
    to communicate an issuance policy to Certification Authorities (CAs) but only
    allows a domain to define a policy with CA-level granularity.  However, the CAA
    specification (RFC 8659) also provides facilities for an extension to admit a
    more granular, CA-specific policy.  This specification defines two such parameters:
    one allowing specific accounts of a CA to be identified by URIs and one allowing
    specific methods of domain control validation as defined by the Automatic Certificate
    Management Environment (ACME) protocol to be required.'
