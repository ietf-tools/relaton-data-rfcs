abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification defines a framework for coupling the Active Queue
    Management (AQM) algorithms in two queues intended for flows with different responses
    to congestion. This provides a way for the Internet to transition from the scaling
    problems of standard TCP-Reno-friendly ('Classic') congestion controls to the
    family of 'Scalable' congestion controls. These are designed for consistently
    very low queuing latency, very low congestion loss, and scaling of per-flow throughput
    by using Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) in a modified way. Until the Coupled
    Dual Queue (DualQ), these Scalable L4S congestion controls could only be deployed
    where a clean-slate environment could be arranged, such as in private data centres.</p><p>This
    specification first explains how a Coupled DualQ works. It then gives the normative
    requirements that are necessary for it to work well. All this is independent of
    which two AQMs are used, but pseudocode examples of specific AQMs are given in
    appendices.</p>"
