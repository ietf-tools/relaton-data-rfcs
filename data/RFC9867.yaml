abstract:
- content: "<p>An Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) extension defined
    in RFC 8784 allows IPsec traffic to be protected against someone storing VPN communications
    and decrypting them later, when (and if) a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum
    Computer (CRQC) is available. The protection is achieved by means of a Post-quantum
    Preshared Key (PPK) that is mixed into the session keys calculation. However,
    this protection does not cover an initial IKEv2 Security Association (SA), which
    might be unacceptable in some scenarios. This specification defines an alternative
    way to provide protection against quantum computers, which is similar to the solution
    defined in RFC 8784, but it also protects the initial IKEv2 SA.</p><p>RFC 8784
    assumes that PPKs are static and thus they are only used when an initial IKEv2
    SA is created. If a fresh PPK is available before the IKE SA expires, then the
    only way to use it is to delete the current IKE SA and create a new one from scratch,
    which is inefficient. This specification defines a way to use PPKs in active IKEv2
    SAs for creating additional IPsec SAs and rekey operations.</p>"
