abstract:
- content: "<p>XDR is a standard for the description and encoding of data. It is useful
    for transferring data between different computer architectures. XDR fits into
    ISO presentation layer, and is roughly analogous in purpose to X.409, ISO Abstract
    Syntax Notation. The major difference between these two is that XDR uses implicit
    typing, while X.409 uses explicit typing. This RFC is distributed for information
    only, it does not establish a Internet standard.</p>"
