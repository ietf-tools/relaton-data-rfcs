abstract:
- content: This document specifies an extension of OSPFv3 to support mobile ad hoc
    networks (MANETs).  The extension, called OSPF-MDR, is designed as a new OSPF
    interface type for MANETs.  OSPF-MDR is based on the selection of a subset of
    MANET routers, consisting of MANET Designated Routers (MDRs) and Backup MDRs.  The
    MDRs form a connected dominating set (CDS), and the MDRs and Backup MDRs together
    form a biconnected CDS for robustness.  This CDS is exploited in two ways.  First,
    to reduce flooding overhead, an optimized flooding procedure is used in which
    only (Backup) MDRs flood new link state advertisements (LSAs) back out the receiving
    interface; reliable flooding is ensured by retransmitting LSAs along adjacencies.  Second,
    adjacencies are formed only between (Backup) MDRs and a subset of their neighbors,
    allowing for much better scaling in dense networks.  The CDS is constructed using
    2-hop neighbor information provided in a Hello protocol extension.  The Hello
    protocol is further optimized by allowing differential Hellos that report only
    changes in neighbor states.  Options are specified for originating router-LSAs
    that provide full or partial topology information, allowing overhead to be reduced
    by advertising less topology information.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol
    for the Internet community.
