abstract:
- content: "<p>This Protocol is one of a set of International Standards produced to
    facilitate the interconnection of open systems. The set of standards covers the
    services and protocols required to achieve such interconnection. This Protocol
    is positioned with respect to other related standards by the layers defined in
    the Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnection (ISO 7498) and by the structure
    defined in the Internal Organization of the Network Layer (DIS 8648). In particular,
    it is a protocol of the Network Layer. This Protocol permits End Systems and Intermediate
    Systems to exchange configuration and routing information to facilitate the operation
    of the routing and relaying functions of the Network Layer.</p>"
