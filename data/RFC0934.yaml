abstract:
- content: <p>This memo concerns itself with message forwarding. Forwarding can be
    thought of as encapsulating one or more messages inside another. Although this
    is useful for transfer of past correspondence to new recipients, without a decapsulation
    process (which this memo terms "bursting"), the forwarded messages are of little
    use to the recipients because they can not be distributed, forwarded, replied-to,
    or otherwise processed as separate individual messages. In order to burst a message
    it is necessary to know how the component messages were encapsulated in the draft.
    At present there is no unambiguous standard for interest group digests. This RFC
    proposes a proposed protocol for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion
    and suggestions for improvements.</p>
