abstract:
- content: "<p>A range of Management Information Base (MIB) modules has been developed
    to help model and manage the various aspects of Multiprotocol Label Switching
    (MPLS) networks. These MIB modules are defined in separate documents that focus
    on the specific areas of responsibility of the modules that they describe.</p><p>The
    MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a profile of MPLS functionality specific to
    the construction of packet-switched transport networks.</p><p>This document describes
    the MIB-based architecture for MPLS-TP, indicates the interrelationships between
    different existing MIB modules that can be leveraged for MPLS-TP network management,
    and identifies areas where additional MIB modules are required. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
