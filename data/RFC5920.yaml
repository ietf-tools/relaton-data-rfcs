abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a security framework for Multiprotocol Label
    Switching (MPLS) and Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Networks.
    This document addresses the security aspects that are relevant in the context
    of MPLS and GMPLS. It describes the security threats, the related defensive techniques,
    and the mechanisms for detection and reporting. This document emphasizes RSVP-TE
    and LDP security considerations, as well as inter-AS and inter-provider security
    considerations for building and maintaining MPLS and GMPLS networks across different
    domains or different Service Providers. This document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</p>"
