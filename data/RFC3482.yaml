abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an overview of E.164 telephone number portability
    (NP) in the Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN). NP is a regulatory imperative
    seeking to liberalize local telephony service competition, by enabling end-users
    to retain telephone numbers while changing service providers. NP changes the fundamental
    nature of a dialed E.164 number from a hierarchical physical routing address to
    a virtual address, thereby requiring the transparent translation of the later
    to the former. In addition, there are various regulatory constraints that establish
    relevant parameters for NP implementation, most of which are not network technology
    specific. Consequently, the implementation of NP behavior consistent with applicable
    regulatory constraints, as well as the need for interoperation with the existing
    GSTN NP implementations, are relevant topics for numerous areas of IP telephony
    works-in-progress with the IETF. This memo provides information for the Internet
    community.</p>"
