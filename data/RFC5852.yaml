abstract:
- content: In a transport network scenario, Data Plane connections controlled by either
    a Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Control Plane (Soft Permanent
    Connections - SPC) or a Management System (Permanent Connections - PC) may independently
    coexist. The ability of transforming an existing PC into an SPC and vice versa
    -- without actually affecting Data Plane traffic being carried over it -- is a
    requirement. The requirements for the conversion between permanent connections
    and switched connections in a GMPLS Network are defined in RFC 5493. This memo
    describes an extension to GMPLS Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering
    (RSVP-TE) signaling that enables the transfer of connection ownership between
    the Management and the Control Planes. Such a transfer is referred to as a Handover.
    This document defines all Handover-related procedures. This includes the handling
    of failure conditions and subsequent reversion to original state. A basic premise
    of the extension is that the Handover procedures must never impact an already
    established Data Plane connection. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
