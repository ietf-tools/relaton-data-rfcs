abstract:
- content: "<p>Path properties express information about paths across a network and
    the services provided via such paths. In a path-aware network, path properties
    may be fully or partially available to entities such as endpoints. This document
    defines and categorizes path properties. Furthermore, the document identifies
    several path properties that might be useful to endpoints or other entities, e.g.,
    for selecting between paths or for invoking some of the provided services. This
    document is a product of the Path Aware Networking Research Group (PANRG).</p>"
