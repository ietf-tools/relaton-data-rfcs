abstract:
- content: RFC 4364 and RFC 4659 define an approach to building provider-provisioned
    Layer 3 VPNs (L3VPNs) for IPv4 and IPv6.  It may be desirable to use Resource
    Reservation Protocol (RSVP) to perform admission control on the links between
    Customer Edge (CE) routers and Provider Edge (PE) routers.  This document specifies
    procedures by which RSVP messages traveling from CE to CE across an L3VPN may
    be appropriately handled by PE routers so that admission control can be performed
    on PE-CE links.  Optionally, admission control across the provider's backbone
    may also be supported. [STANDARDS-TRACK]
