abstract:
- content: "<p>A device can be simultaneously connected to multiple networks, e.g.,
    Wi-Fi, LTE, 5G, and DSL. It is desirable to seamlessly combine the connectivity
    over these networks below the transport layer (L4) to improve the quality of experience
    for applications that do not have built-in multi-path capabilities. Such optimization
    requires additional control information, e.g., a sequence number, in each packet.
    This document presents a new lightweight and flexible encapsulation protocol for
    this need. The solution has been developed by the authors based on their experiences
    in multiple standards bodies including the IETF and 3GPP. However, this document
    is not an Internet Standard and does not represent the consensus opinion of the
    IETF. This document will enable other developers to build interoperable implementations
    in order to experiment with the protocol.</p>"
