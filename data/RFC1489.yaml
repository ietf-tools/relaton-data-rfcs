abstract:
- content: <p>Though the proposed character set "koi8-r" is not currently an international
    standard, there is very large user community (including Relcom Net) supporting
    it. Factually, "koi8-r" is de-facto standard for Unix and global network applications
    in the former Soviet Union. This is the reason the Society of Unix User Groups
    (SUUG) believes "koi8-r" should be registered. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community. It does not specify an Internet standard.</p>
