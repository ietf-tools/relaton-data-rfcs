abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes an application-level protocol for the communication
    of end-to-end QoS compliance information based on the HyperText Transfer Protocol
    (HTTP) and the Session Description Protocol (SDP). The Quality for Service (Q4S)
    protocol provides a mechanism to negotiate and monitor latency, jitter, bandwidth,
    and packet loss, and to alert whenever one of the negotiated conditions is violated.</p><p>Implementation
    details on the actions to be triggered upon reception/detection of QoS alerts
    exchanged by the protocol are out of scope of this document; it is either application
    dependent (e.g., act to increase quality or reduce bit-rate) or network dependent
    (e.g., change connection's quality profile).</p><p>This protocol specification
    is the product of research conducted over a number of years; it is presented here
    as a permanent record and to offer a foundation for future similar work. It does
    not represent a standard protocol and does not have IETF consensus.</p>"
