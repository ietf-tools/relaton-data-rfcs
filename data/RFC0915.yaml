abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC proposed a new service for the ARPA-Internet community and
    requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. The network mail path service
    fills the current need of people to determine mailbox addresses for hosts that
    are not part of the ARPA-Internet but can be reached by one or more relay hosts
    that have Unix to Unix Copy (UUCP) mail, CSNET mail, MAILNET mail, BITNET mail,
    etc. Anyone can use the service if they have TCP/TELENET to one of the hosts with
    a mail path server.</p>"
