abstract:
- content: "<p>In multiconnectivity scenarios, the clients can simultaneously connect
    to multiple networks based on different access technologies and network architectures
    like Wi-Fi, LTE, and DSL. Both the quality of experience of the users and the
    overall network utilization and efficiency may be improved through the smart selection
    and combination of access and core network paths that can dynamically adapt to
    changing network conditions.</p><p>This document presents a unified problem statement
    and introduces a solution for managing multiconnectivity. The solution has been
    developed by the authors based on their experiences in multiple standards bodies,
    including the IETF and the 3GPP. However, this document is not an Internet Standards
    Track specification, and it does not represent the consensus opinion of the IETF.</p><p>This
    document describes requirements, solution principles, and the architecture of
    the Multi-Access Management Services (MAMS) framework. The MAMS framework aims
    to provide best performance while being easy to implement in a wide variety of
    multiconnectivity deployments. It specifies the protocol for (1) flexibly selecting
    the best combination of access and core network paths for the uplink and downlink,
    and (2) determining the user-plane treatment (e.g., tunneling, encryption) and
    traffic distribution over the selected links, to ensure network efficiency and
    the best possible application performance.</p>"
