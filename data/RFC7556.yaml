abstract:
- content: This document is a product of the work of the Multiple Interfaces Architecture
    Design team.  It outlines a solution framework for some of the issues experienced
    by nodes that can be attached to multiple networks simultaneously.  The framework
    defines the concept of a Provisioning Domain (PvD), which is a consistent set
    of network configuration information.  PvD-aware nodes learn PvD-specific information
    from the networks they are attached to and/or other sources.  PvDs are used to
    enable separation and configuration consistency in the presence of multiple concurrent
    connections.
