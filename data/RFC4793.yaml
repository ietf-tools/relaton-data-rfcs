abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a general Extensible Authentication Protocol
    (EAP) method suitable for use with One-Time Password (OTP) tokens, and offers
    particular advantages for tokens with direct electronic interfaces to their associated
    clients. The method can be used to provide unilateral or mutual authentication,
    and key material, in protocols utilizing EAP, such as PPP, IEEE 802.1X, and Internet
    Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2). This memo provides information for the
    Internet community.</p>"
