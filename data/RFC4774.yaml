abstract:
- content: "<p>There have been a number of proposals for alternate semantics for the
    Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) field in the IP header RFC 3168.  This
    document discusses some of the issues in defining alternate semantics for the
    ECN field, and specifies requirements for a safe coexistence in an Internet that
    could include routers that do not understand the defined alternate semantics.
    \ This document evolved as a result of discussions with the authors of one recent
    proposal for such alternate semantics.  This document specifies an Internet Best
    Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions
    for improvements.</p>"
