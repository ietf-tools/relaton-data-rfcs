abstract:
- content: "<p>The Handle System is a general-purpose global name service that allows
    secured name resolution and administration over the public Internet. This document
    provides a detailed description of the Handle System namespace, and its data,
    service, and operation models. The namespace definition specifies the handle syntax
    and its semantic structure. The data model defines the data structures used by
    the Handle System protocol and any pre-defined data types for carrying out the
    handle service. The service model provides definitions of various Handle System
    components and explains how they work together over the network. Finally, the
    Handle System operation model describes its service operation in terms of messages
    transmitted between client and server, and the client authentication process based
    on the Handle System authentication protocol.</p>"
