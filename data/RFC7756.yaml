abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an extension of the Stateless IP/ICMP Translation
    for IPv6 Internet Data Center Environments (SIIT-DC) architecture, which allows
    applications, protocols, or nodes that are incompatible with IPv6 and/or Network
    Address Translation to operate correctly with SIIT-DC. This is accomplished by
    introducing a new component called an SIIT-DC Edge Relay, which reverses the translations
    made by an SIIT-DC Border Relay. The application and/or node is thus provided
    with seemingly native IPv4 connectivity that provides end-to-end address transparency.</p><p>The
    reader is expected to be familiar with the SIIT-DC architecture described in RFC
    7755.</p>"
