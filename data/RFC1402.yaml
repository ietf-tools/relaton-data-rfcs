abstract:
- content: "<p>The ultimate goal is to make the route to these sources of information
    invisible to you. At present, this is not easy to do. I will explain some of the
    techniques that can be used to make these nuggets easier to pick up so that we
    all can be richer. This RFC provides information for the Internet community. It
    does not specify an Internet standard.</p>"
