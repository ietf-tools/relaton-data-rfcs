abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an Architectural description and the Concept
    of Operations of some optional advanced deployment scenarios for the Identifier-Locator
    Network Protocol (ILNP), which is an evolutionary enhancement to IP. None of the
    functions described here is required for the use or deployment of ILNP. Instead,
    it offers descriptions of engineering and deployment options that might provide
    either enhanced capability or convenience in administration or management of ILNP-based
    systems. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
