abstract:
- content: <p>This memo describes the process for early allocation of code points
    by IANA from registries for which "Specification Required", "RFC Required", "IETF
    Review", or "Standards Action" policies apply. This process can be used to alleviate
    the problem where code point allocation is needed to facilitate desired or required
    implementation and deployment experience prior to publication of an RFC, which
    would normally trigger code point allocation. The procedures in this document
    are intended to apply only to IETF Stream documents.</p>
