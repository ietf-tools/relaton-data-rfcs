abstract:
- content: This document specifies requirements for a generic route-tracing application.  It
    also specifies requirements for a protocol that will support that application.  Network
    operators will use the generic route-tracing application to verify proper operation
    of the IP forwarding plane.  They will also use the application to discover details
    regarding tunnels that support IP forwarding.  The generic route-tracing application,
    specified herein, supports a superset of the functionality that "traceroute" currently
    offers.  Like traceroute, the generic route-tracing application can discover the
    forwarding path between two interfaces that are contained by an IP network.  Unlike
    traceroute, this application can reveal details regarding tunnels that support
    the IP forwarding path.
