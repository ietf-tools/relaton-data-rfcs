abstract:
- content: "<p>It is not uncommon for resource servers to require different authentication
    strengths or recentness according to the characteristics of a request. This document
    introduces a mechanism that resource servers can use to signal to a client that
    the authentication event associated with the access token of the current request
    does not meet its authentication requirements and, further, how to meet them.
    This document also codifies a mechanism for a client to request that an authorization
    server achieve a specific authentication strength or recentness when processing
    an authorization request.</p>"
