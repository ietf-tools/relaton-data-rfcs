abstract:
- content: "<p>The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) provides Representational
    State Transfer (RESTful) web services to retrieve registration metadata from domain
    name and regional internet registries. RDAP allows a server to make access control
    decisions based on client identity, and as such, it includes support for client
    identification features provided by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Identification
    methods that require clients to obtain and manage credentials from every RDAP
    server operator present management challenges for both clients and servers, whereas
    a federated authentication system would make it easier to operate and use RDAP
    without the need to maintain server-specific client credentials. This document
    describes a federated authentication system for RDAP based on OpenID Connect.</p>"
