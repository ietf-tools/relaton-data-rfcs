abstract:
- content: "<p>Traditional mail systems handle only ASCII characters in SMTP envelope
    and mail header fields. The Email Address Internationalization (UTF8SMTP) extension
    allows UTF-8 characters in SMTP envelope and mail header fields. To avoid rejecting
    internationalized email messages when a server in the delivery path does not support
    the UTF8SMTP extension, some sort of converting mechanism is required. This document
    describes a downgrading mechanism for Email Address Internationalization. Note
    that this is a way to downgrade, not tunnel. There is no associated up-conversion
    mechanism, although internationalized email clients might use original internationalized
    addresses or other data when displaying or replying to downgraded messages. This
    memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
