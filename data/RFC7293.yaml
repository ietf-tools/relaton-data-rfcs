abstract:
- content: <p>This document defines an extension for the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
    (SMTP) called "RRVS" to provide a method for senders to indicate to receivers
    a point in time when the ownership of the target mailbox was known to the sender.
    This can be used to detect changes of mailbox ownership and thus prevent mail
    from being delivered to the wrong party. This document also defines a header field
    called "Require-Recipient-Valid-Since" that can be used to tunnel the request
    through servers that do not support the extension.</p><p>The intended use of these
    facilities is on automatically generated messages, such as account statements
    or password change instructions, that might contain sensitive information, though
    it may also be useful in other applications.</p>
