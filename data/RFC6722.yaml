abstract:
- content: <p>This document describes how the "Tao of the IETF", which has been published
    as a series of RFCs in the past, is instead being published as a web page. It
    also contains the procedure for publishing and editing that web page. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>
