abstract:
- content: "<p>National Bibliography Numbers (NBNs) are used by national libraries
    and other organizations in order to identify resources in their collections. NBNs
    are usually applied to resources that are not catered for by established (standard)
    identifier systems such as International Standard Book Number (ISBN).</p><p>A
    Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace for NBNs was established in 2001 in RFC
    3188. Since then, a number of European national libraries have implemented URN:NBN-based
    systems.</p><p>This document replaces RFC 3188 and defines how NBNs can be supported
    within the updated URN framework. A revised namespace registration (version 4)
    compliant to RFC 8141 is included.</p>"
