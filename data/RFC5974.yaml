abstract:
  content: This specification describes the NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP) for
    signaling Quality of Service (QoS) reservations in the Internet.  It is in accordance
    with the framework and requirements developed in NSIS.  Together with General
    Internet Signaling Transport (GIST), it provides functionality similar to RSVP
    and extends it.  The QoS NSLP is independent of the underlying QoS specification
    or architecture and provides support for different reservation models.  It is
    simplified by the elimination of support for multicast flows.  This specification
    explains the overall protocol approach, describes the design decisions made, and
    provides examples.  It specifies object, message formats, and processing rules.  This
    document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.
