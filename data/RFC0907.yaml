abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Host Access Protocol (HAP).  Although HAP
    was originally designed as the network-access level protocol for the DARPA/DCA
    sponsored Wideband Packet Satellite Network, it is intended that it evolve into
    a standard interface SATNET and TACNET (aka MATNET) as well as the Wideband Network.
    \ HAP is an experimental protocol, and will undergo further revision as new capabilities
    are added and/or different satellite networks are suported.  Implementations of
    HAP should be performed in coordination with satellite network development and
    operations personnel.</p>"
