abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the basic principle for establishing a mesh,
    that interoperating services should exchange index objects, according to the architecture
    of the mesh (e.g., hierarchical, or graph-like, preferably without loops!). The
    Common Indexing Protocol (CIP) is designed to facilitate the creation not only
    of query referral indexes, but also of meshes of (loosely) affiliated referral
    indexes. The purpose of such a mesh of servers is to implement some kind of distributed
    sharing of indexing and/or searching tasks across different servers. So far, the
    TISDAG (Technical Infrastructure for Swedish Directory Access Gateways) project
    has focused on creating a single referral index; the obvious next step is to integrate
    that into a larger set of interoperating services. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
