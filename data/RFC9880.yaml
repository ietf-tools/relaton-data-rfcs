abstract:
- content: "<p>The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts
    to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models that describe
    Things, i.e., physical objects that are available for interaction over a network.
    An SDF specification describes definitions of SDF Objects/SDF Things and their
    associated interactions (Events, Actions, and Properties), as well as the Data
    types for the information exchanged in those interactions. Tools convert this
    format to database formats and other serializations as needed.</p>"
