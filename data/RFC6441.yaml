abstract:
- content: "<p>It has been common for network administrators to filter IP traffic
    from and BGP prefixes of unallocated IPv4 address space. Now that there are no
    longer any unallocated IPv4 /8s, this practise is more complicated, fragile, and
    expensive. Network administrators are advised to remove filters based on the registration
    status of the address space.</p><p>This document explains why any remaining packet
    and BGP prefix filters for unallocated IPv4 /8s should now be removed on border
    routers and documents those IPv4 unicast prefixes that should not be routed across
    the public Internet. This memo documents an Internet Best Current Practice.</p>"
