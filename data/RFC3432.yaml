abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo describes a periodic sampling method and relevant metrics
    for assessing the performance of IP networks. First, the memo motivates periodic
    sampling and addresses the question of its value as an alternative to the Poisson
    sampling described in RFC 2330. The benefits include applicability to active and
    passive measurements, simulation of constant bit rate (CBR) traffic (typical of
    multimedia communication, or nearly CBR, as found with voice activity detection),
    and several instances in which analysis can be simplified. The sampling method
    avoids predictability by mandating random start times and finite length tests.
    Following descriptions of the sampling method and sample metric parameters, measurement
    methods and errors are discussed. Finally, we give additional information on periodic
    measurements, including security considerations. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
