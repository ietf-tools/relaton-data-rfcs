- content: |-
    <p>This specification defines UUIDs (Universally Unique IDentifiers) --
    also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique IDentifiers) -- and a Uniform
    Resource Name namespace for UUIDs. A UUID is 128 bits long and is
    intended to guarantee uniqueness across space and time. UUIDs were
    originally used in the Apollo Network Computing System (NCS), later
    in the Open Software Foundation's (OSF's) Distributed Computing
    Environment (DCE), and then in Microsoft Windows platforms.</p><p>This specification is derived from the OSF DCE specification with the
    kind permission of the OSF (now known as "The Open Group"). Information from earlier versions of the OSF DCE specification have
    been incorporated into this document. This document obsoletes RFC
    4122.</p>
