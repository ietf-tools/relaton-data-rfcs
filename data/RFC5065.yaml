abstract:
- content: <p>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an inter-autonomous system routing
    protocol designed for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)
    networks. BGP requires that all BGP speakers within a single autonomous system
    (AS) must be fully meshed. This represents a serious scaling problem that has
    been well documented in a number of proposals.</p><p>This document describes an
    extension to BGP that may be used to create a confederation of autonomous systems
    that is represented as a single autonomous system to BGP peers external to the
    confederation, thereby removing the "full mesh" requirement. The intention of
    this extension is to aid in policy administration and reduce the management complexity
    of maintaining a large autonomous system.</p><p>This document obsoletes RFC 3065.
