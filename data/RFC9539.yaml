abstract:
- content: "<p>This document sets out steps that DNS servers (recursive resolvers
    and authoritative servers) can take unilaterally (without any coordination with
    other peers) to defend DNS query privacy against a passive network monitor. The
    protections provided by the guidance in this document can be defeated by an active
    attacker, but they should be simpler and less risky to deploy than more powerful
    defenses.</p><p>The goal of this document is to simplify and speed up deployment
    of opportunistic encrypted transport in the recursive-to-authoritative hop of
    the DNS ecosystem. Wider easy deployment of the underlying encrypted transport
    on an opportunistic basis may facilitate the future specification of stronger
    cryptographic protections against more-powerful attacks.</p>"
