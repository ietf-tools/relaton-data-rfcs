abstract:
- content: "<p>This memo outlines high-level requirements for the integration of flexible
    Mandatory Access Control (MAC) functionality into the Network File System (NFS)
    version 4.2 (NFSv4.2). It describes the level of protections that should be provided
    over protocol components and the basic structure of the proposed system. The intent
    here is not to present the protocol changes but to describe the environment in
    which they reside.</p>"
