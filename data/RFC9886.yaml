abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Domain Name System (DNS) functionality of
    a Drone Remote Identification Protocol (DRIP) Identity Management Entity (DIME).
    It is built around DRIP Entity Tags (DETs) to standardize a hierarchical registry
    structure and associated processes to facilitate trustable and scalable registration
    and lookup of information related to Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). The registry
    system supports issuance, discovery, and verification of DETs, enabling secure
    identification and association of UAS and their operators. It also defines the
    interactions between different classes of registries (root, organizational, and
    individual) and their respective roles in maintaining the integrity of the registration
    data. This architecture enables decentralized, federated operation while supporting
    privacy, traceability, and regulatory compliance requirements in the context of
    UAS Remote Identification and other services.</p>"
