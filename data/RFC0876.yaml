abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC is a survey of implementation status. It does not specify
    an official protocol, but rather notes the status of implementation of aspects
    of a protocol. It is expected that the status of the hosts reported on will change.
    This information must be treated as a snapshot of the state of these implemetations.</p>"
