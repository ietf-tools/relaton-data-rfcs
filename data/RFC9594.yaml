abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines how to use the Authentication and Authorization
    for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework to distribute keying material and
    configuration parameters for secure group communication. Candidate group members
    that act as Clients and are authorized to join a group can do so by interacting
    with a Key Distribution Center (KDC) acting as the Resource Server, from which
    they obtain the keying material to communicate with other group members. While
    defining general message formats as well as the interface and operations available
    at the KDC, this document supports different approaches and protocols for secure
    group communication. Therefore, details are delegated to separate application
    profiles of this document as specialized instances that target a particular group
    communication approach and define how communications in the group are protected.
    Compliance requirements for such application profiles are also specified.</p>"
