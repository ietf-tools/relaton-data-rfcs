abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a profile for Congestion Control Identifier
    4, the small-packet variant of TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC), in the Datagram
    Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP). CCID 4 is for experimental use, and uses TFRC-SP
    (RFC 4828), a variant of TFRC designed for applications that send small packets.
    CCID 4 is considered experimental because TFRC-SP is itself experimental, and
    is not proposed for widespread deployment in the global Internet at this time.
    The goal for TFRC-SP is to achieve roughly the same bandwidth in bits per second
    (bps) as a TCP flow using packets of up to 1500 bytes but experiencing the same
    level of congestion. CCID 4 is for use for senders that send small packets and
    would like a TCP- friendly sending rate, possibly with Explicit Congestion Notification
    (ECN), while minimizing abrupt rate changes. This memo defines an Experimental
    Protocol for the Internet community.</p>"
