abstract:
- content: "<p>The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol (RFC 5880) is
    used to detect loss of connectivity between two forwarding engines, typically
    with low latency. BFD is leveraged by routing protocols, including the Border
    Gateway Protocol (BGP), to bring down routing protocol connections more quickly
    than the original protocol timers.</p><p>This document defines a subcode for the
    BGP Cease NOTIFICATION message (Section 6.7 of RFC 4271) for use when a BGP connection
    is being closed due to a BFD session going down.</p>"
