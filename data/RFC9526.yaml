abstract:
- content: "<p>Home network owners may have devices or services hosted on their home
    network that they wish to access from the Internet (i.e., from a network outside
    of the home network). Home networks are increasingly numbered using IPv6 addresses,
    which in principle makes this access simpler, but accessing home networks from
    the Internet requires the names and IP addresses of these devices and services
    to be made available in the public DNS.</p><p>This document describes how a Home
    Naming Authority (NHA) instructs the outsourced infrastructure to publish these
    pieces of information in the public DNS. The names and IP addresses of the home
    network are set in the Public Homenet Zone by the Homenet Naming Authority (HNA),
    which in turn instructs an outsourced infrastructure to publish the zone on behalf
    of the home network owner.</p>"
