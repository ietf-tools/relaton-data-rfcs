abstract:
- content: "<p>Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) provides a means of attesting
    the identity of a telephone caller via a signed token in order to prevent impersonation
    of a calling party number, which is a key enabler for illegal robocalling. Similar
    impersonation is sometimes leveraged by bad actors in the text and multimedia
    messaging space. This document explores the applicability of STIR's Personal Assertion
    Token (PASSporT) and certificate issuance framework to text and multimedia messaging
    use cases, including support for both messages carried as a payload in SIP requests
    and messages sent in sessions negotiated by SIP.</p>"
