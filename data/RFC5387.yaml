abstract:
- content: <p>The Internet network security protocol suite, IPsec, requires authentication,
    usually of network-layer entities, to enable access control and provide security
    services. This authentication can be based on mechanisms such as pre-shared symmetric
    keys, certificates with associated asymmetric keys, or the use of Kerberos (via
    Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys (KINK)). The need to deploy authentication
    information and its associated identities can be a significant obstacle to the
    use of IPsec.</p><p>This document explains the rationale for extending the Internet
    network security protocol suite to enable use of IPsec security services without
    authentication. These extensions are intended to protect communication, providing
    "better-than-nothing security" (BTNS). The extensions may be used on their own
    (this use is called Stand-Alone BTNS, or SAB) or may be used to provide network-layer
    security that can be authenticated by higher layers in the protocol stack (this
    use is called Channel-Bound BTNS, or CBB). The document also explains situations
    for which use of SAB and/or CBB extensions are applicable. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community.</p>
