abstract:
- content: "<p>This Glossary provides definitions, abbreviations, and explanations
    of terminology for information system security. The 334 pages of entries offer
    recommendations to improve the comprehensibility of written material that is generated
    in the Internet Standards Process (RFC 2026). The recommendations follow the principles
    that such writing should (a) use the same term or definition whenever the same
    concept is mentioned; (b) use terms in their plainest, dictionary sense; (c) use
    terms that are already well-established in open publications; and (d) avoid terms
    that either favor a particular vendor or favor a particular technology or mechanism
    over other, competing techniques that already exist or could be developed. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
