abstract:
- content: "<p>This document has been reviewed by the Federal Engineering Task Force
    (FEPG) on behalf of the Federal Networking Council (FNC), the co-chairs of the
    International Engineering Planning Group (IEPG), and the Reseaux IP Europeens
    (RIPE). There was general consensus by those groups to support the recommendations
    proposed in this document for management of the IP address space. This memo provides
    information for the Internet community. It does not specify an Internet standard.
    This RFC suggests an extension to the IP protocol to solve the shortage of IP
    address problem, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. This
    memo provides information for the Internet community. It does not specify an Internet
    standard. This memo defines the various criteria to be used when designing Autonomous
    System Border Routers (ASBR) that will run BGP with other ASBRs external to the
    AS and OSPF as its IGP. [STANDARDS-TRACK] 1363 Partridge Spt 92 A Proposed Flow
    Specification The flow specification defined in this memo is intended for information
    and possible experimentation (i.e., experimental use by consenting routers and
    applications only). This RFC is a product of the Internet Research Task Force
    (IRTF). This memo provides information for the Internet community. It does not
    specify an Internet standard.</p>"
