abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes an architecture that provides some assurance
    that service instances are running as expected. As services rely upon multiple
    subservices provided by a variety of elements, including the underlying network
    devices and functions, getting the assurance of a healthy service is only possible
    with a holistic view of all involved elements. This architecture not only helps
    to correlate the service degradation with symptoms of a specific network component
    but, it also lists the services impacted by the failure or degradation of a specific
    network component.</p>"
