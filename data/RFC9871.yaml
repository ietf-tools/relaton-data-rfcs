abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a BGP-based routing solution to establish end-to-end
    intent-aware paths across a multi-domain transport network. The transport network
    can span multiple service provider and customer network domains. The BGP intent-aware
    paths can be used to steer traffic flows for service routes that need a specific
    intent. This solution is called BGP Color-Aware Routing (BGP CAR).</p><p>This
    document describes the routing framework and BGP extensions to enable intent-aware
    routing using the BGP CAR solution. The solution defines two new BGP SAFIs (BGP
    CAR SAFI and BGP VPN CAR SAFI) for IPv4 and IPv6. It also defines an extensible
    Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) model for both SAFIs that allows
    multiple NLRI types to be defined for different use cases. Each type of NLRI contains
    key and TLV-based non-key fields for efficient encoding of different per-prefix
    information. This specification defines two NLRI types: Color-Aware Route NLRI
    and IP Prefix NLRI. It defines non-key TLV types for the MPLS label stack, SR-MPLS
    label index, and Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) Segment Identifiers (SIDs).
    This solution also defines a new Local Color Mapping (LCM) Extended Community.</p>"
