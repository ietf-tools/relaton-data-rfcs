abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes SPAKE2, which is a protocol for two parties
    that share a password to derive a strong shared key without disclosing the password.
    This method is compatible with any group, is computationally efficient, and has
    a security proof. This document predated the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG)
    password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) competition, and it was not selected;
    however, given existing use of variants in Kerberos and other applications, it
    was felt that publication was beneficial. Applications that need a symmetric PAKE,
    but are unable to hash onto an elliptic curve at execution time, can use SPAKE2.
    This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group in the Internet
    Research Task Force (IRTF).</p>"
