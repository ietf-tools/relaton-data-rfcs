abstract:
- content: "<p>The DNSSEC protocol makes use of various cryptographic algorithms to
    provide authentication of DNS data and proof of nonexistence. To ensure interoperability
    between DNS resolvers and DNS authoritative servers, it is necessary to specify
    both a set of algorithm implementation requirements and usage guidelines to ensure
    that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations support. This document
    replaces and obsoletes RFC 8624 and moves the canonical source of algorithm implementation
    requirements and usage guidance for DNSSEC from RFC 8624 to the IANA DNSSEC algorithm
    registries. This is done to allow the list of requirements to be more easily updated
    and referenced. Extensions to these registries can be made in future RFCs. This
    document also updates RFC 9157 and incorporates the revised IANA DNSSEC considerations
    from that RFC.</p><p>This document does not change the recommendation status (MUST,
    MAY, RECOMMENDED, etc.) of the algorithms listed in RFC 8624; that is the work
    of future documents.</p>"
