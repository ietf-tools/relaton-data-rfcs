abstract:
- content: "<p>This text describes evolving networking technology within residential
    home networks with increasing numbers of devices and a trend towards increased
    internal routing. The goal of this document is to define a general architecture
    for IPv6-based home networking, describing the associated principles, considerations,
    and requirements. The text briefly highlights specific implications of the introduction
    of IPv6 for home networking, discusses the elements of the architecture, and suggests
    how standard IPv6 mechanisms and addressing can be employed in home networking.
    The architecture describes the need for specific protocol extensions for certain
    additional functionality. It is assumed that the IPv6 home network is not actively
    managed and runs as an IPv6-only or dual-stack network. There are no recommendations
    in this text for the IPv4 part of the network.</p>"
