abstract:
- content: "<p>The IEEE originally structured the 48-bit Media Access Control (MAC)
    address space in such a way that half of it was reserved for local use. In 2017,
    the IEEE published a new standard (IEEE Std 802c) with a new optional Structured
    Local Address Plan (SLAP). It specifies different assignment approaches in four
    specified regions of the local MAC address space.</p><p>The IEEE is developing
    protocols to assign addresses (IEEE P802.1CQ). There is also work in the IETF
    on specifying a new mechanism that extends DHCPv6 operation to handle the local
    MAC address assignments.</p><p>This document proposes extensions to DHCPv6 protocols
    to enable a DHCPv6 client or a DHCPv6 relay to indicate a preferred SLAP quadrant
    to the server so that the server may allocate MAC addresses in the quadrant requested
    by the relay or client. A new DHCPv6 option (QUAD) is defined for this purpose.</p>"
