abstract:
- content: "<p>Today, customers expect to run triple-play services through BGP/MPLS
    IP-VPNs. Some service providers will deploy services that request Quality of Service
    (QoS) guarantees from a local Customer Edge (CE) to a remote CE across the network.
    As a result, the application (e.g., voice, video, bandwidth-guaranteed data pipe,
    etc.) requirements for an end-to-end QoS and reserving an adequate bandwidth continue
    to increase.</p><p>Service providers can use both an MPLS and an MPLS Traffic
    Engineering (MPLS-TE) Label Switched Path (LSP) to meet their service objectives.
    This document describes service-provider requirements for supporting a customer
    Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) and RSVP-TE over a BGP/MPLS IP-VPN. This
    document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for
    informational purposes.</p>"
