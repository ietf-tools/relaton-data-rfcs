abstract:
- content: '<p>The REGISTER function is used in a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    system primarily to associate a temporary contact address with an address-of-record.
    This contact is generally in the form of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI),
    such as Contact: and is generally dynamic and associated with the IP address or
    hostname of the SIP User Agent (UA). The problem is that network topology may
    have one or more SIP proxies between the UA and the registrar, such that any request
    traveling from the user''s home network to the registered UA must traverse these
    proxies. The REGISTER method does not give us a mechanism to discover and record
    this sequence of proxies in the registrar for future use. This document defines
    an extension header field, "Path" which provides such a mechanism. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>'
