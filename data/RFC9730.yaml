abstract:
- content: "<p>Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control allows each
    network element (NE) to perform local resource discovery, routing, and signaling
    in a distributed manner.</p><p>The advancement of software-defined transport networking
    technology enables a group of NEs to be managed through centralized controller
    hierarchies. This helps to tackle challenges arising from multiple domains, vendors,
    and technologies. An example of such a centralized architecture is the Abstraction
    and Control of Traffic-Engineered Networks (ACTN) controller hierarchy, as described
    in RFC 8453.</p><p>Both the distributed and centralized control planes have their
    respective advantages and should complement each other in the system, rather than
    compete. This document outlines how the GMPLS distributed control plane can work
    together with a centralized controller system in a transport network.</p>"
