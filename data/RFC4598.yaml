abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload
    format for transporting Enhanced AC-3 (E-AC-3) encoded audio data. E-AC-3 is a
    high-quality, multichannel audio coding format and is an extension of the AC-3
    audio coding format, which is used in US High-Definition Television (HDTV), DVD,
    cable and satellite television, and other media. E-AC-3 is an optional audio format
    in US and world wide digital television and high-definition DVD formats. The RTP
    payload format as presented in this document includes support for data fragmentation.
