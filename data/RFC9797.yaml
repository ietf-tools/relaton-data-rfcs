abstract:
- content: "<p>To limit the privacy issues created by the association between a device,
    its traffic, its location, and its user in IEEE 802 networks, client vendors and
    client OS vendors have started implementing Media Access Control (MAC) address
    randomization. This technology is particularly important in Wi-Fi networks (defined
    in IEEE 802.11) due to the over-the-air medium and device mobility. When such
    randomization happens, some in-network states may break, which may affect network
    connectivity and user experience. At the same time, devices may continue using
    other stable identifiers, defeating the purpose of MAC address randomization.</p><p>This
    document lists various network environments and a range of network services that
    may be affected by such randomization. This document then examines settings where
    the user experience may be affected by in-network state disruption. Last, this
    document examines some existing frameworks that maintain user privacy while preserving
    user quality of experience and network operation efficiency.</p>"
