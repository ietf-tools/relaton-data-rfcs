abstract:
- content: "<p>The Host-Front End Protocol introduced in RFC-928 is described in detail
    in this memo. The first order of business is to declare that THIS IS A PROPOSAL,
    NOT A FINAL STANDARD, and the second order of business is to request that any
    readers of these documents who are able to do test implementations (a) do so and
    (b) coordinate their efforts with the author. This RFC suggests a proposed protocol
    for the ARPA-Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
