abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the integration of the Network Service Header
    (NSH) and Segment Routing (SR), as well as encapsulation details, to efficiently
    support Service Function Chaining (SFC) while maintaining separation of the service
    and transport planes as originally intended by the SFC architecture.</p><p>Combining
    these technologies allows SR to be used for steering packets between Service Function
    Forwarders (SFFs) along a given Service Function Path (SFP), whereas the NSH is
    responsible for maintaining the integrity of the service plane, the SFC instance
    context, and any associated metadata.</p><p>This integration demonstrates that
    the NSH and SR can work cooperatively and provide a network operator with the
    flexibility to use whichever transport technology makes sense in specific areas
    of their network infrastructure while still maintaining an end-to-end service
    plane using the NSH.</p>"
