abstract:
- content: "<p>The PCE is a core component of a Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
    system. It can be used to compute optimal paths for network traffic and update
    existing paths to reflect changes in the network or traffic demands. The PCE was
    developed to derive Traffic Engineering (TE) paths in MPLS networks, which are
    supplied to the headend of the paths using the Path Computation Element Communication
    Protocol (PCEP).</p><p>SDN has much broader applicability than signalled MPLS
    TE networks, and the PCE may be used to determine paths in a range of use cases
    including static Label-Switched Paths (LSPs), Segment Routing (SR), Service Function
    Chaining (SFC), and most forms of a routed or switched network. Therefore, it
    is reasonable to consider PCEP as a control protocol for use in these environments
    to allow the PCE to be fully enabled as a central controller.</p><p>A PCE as a
    Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of a distributed control
    plane by blending it with elements of SDN without necessarily completely replacing
    it. This document describes general considerations for PCECC deployment and examines
    its applicability and benefits, as well as its challenges and limitations, through
    a number of use cases. PCEP extensions, which are required for the PCECC use cases,
    are covered in separate documents.</p>"
