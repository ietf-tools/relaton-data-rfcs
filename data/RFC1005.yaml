abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC is a proposed specification for the encoding of Class A IP
    addresses for use on ARPANET-style networks such as the Milnet and Arpanet, and
    for enhancements to the ARPANET AHIP Host Access Protocol (AHIP; formerly known
    as 1822). These enhancements increase the size of the PSN field, allow ARPANET
    hosts to use logical names to address each other, allow for the communication
    of type-of-service information from the host to the PSN and enable the PSN to
    provide congestion feedback to the host on a connection basis.</p>"
