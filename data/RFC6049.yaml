abstract:
- content: <p>This memo utilizes IP performance metrics that are applicable to both
    complete paths and sub-paths, and it defines relationships to compose a complete
    path metric from the sub-path metrics with some accuracy with regard to the actual
    metrics. This is called "spatial composition" in RFC 2330. The memo refers to
    the framework for metric composition, and provides background and motivation for
    combining metrics to derive others. The descriptions of several composed metrics
    and statistics follow. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>
