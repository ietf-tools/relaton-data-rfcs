abstract:
- content: "<p>The Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT) is specified in RFC 8225 to
    convey cryptographically signed information about the people involved in personal
    communications. This document extends PASSporT to include an indication that a
    call has been diverted from its original destination to a new one. This information
    can greatly improve the decisions made by verification services in call forwarding
    scenarios. Also specified here is an encapsulation mechanism for nesting a PASSporT
    within another PASSporT that assists relying parties in some diversion scenarios.</p><p>This
    document updates RFC 8224.</p>"
