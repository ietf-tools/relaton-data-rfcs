abstract:
- content: "<p>The Parallel Network File System (pNFS) allows for a file's metadata
    and data to be on different servers (i.e., the metadata server (MDS) and the data
    server (DS)). When the MDS is restarted, the client can still modify the data
    file component. During the recovery phase of startup, the MDS and the DSs work
    together to recover state. If the client has not encountered errors with the data
    files, then the state can be recovered and the resilvering of the data files can
    be avoided. With any errors, there is no means by which the client can report
    errors to the MDS. As such, the MDS has to assume that a file needs resilvering.
    This document presents an extension to RFC 8435 to allow the client to update
    the metadata via LAYOUTRETURN and avoid the resilvering.</p>"
