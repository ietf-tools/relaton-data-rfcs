abstract:
- content: "<p>Neighbor Discovery Proxies are used to provide an address presence
    on a link for nodes that are no longer present on the link. They allow a node
    to receive packets directed at its address by allowing another device to perform
    Neighbor Discovery operations on its behalf.</p><p>Neighbor Discovery Proxy is
    used in Mobile IPv6 and related protocols to provide reachability from nodes on
    the home network when a Mobile Node is not at home, by allowing the Home Agent
    to act as proxy. It is also used as a mechanism to allow a global prefix to span
    multiple links, where proxies act as relays for Neighbor Discovery messages.</p><p>Neighbor
    Discovery Proxy currently cannot be secured using Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND).
    Today, SEND assumes that a node advertising an address is the address owner and
    in possession of appropriate public and private keys for that node. This document
    describes how existing practice for proxy Neighbor Discovery relates to SEND.
    This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published
    for informational purposes.</p>"
