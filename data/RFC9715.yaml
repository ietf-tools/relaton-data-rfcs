abstract:
- content: "<p>The widely deployed Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(0)) feature
    in the DNS enables a DNS receiver to indicate its received UDP message size capacity,
    which supports the sending of large UDP responses by a DNS server. Large DNS/UDP
    messages are more likely to be fragmented, and IP fragmentation has exposed weaknesses
    in application protocols. It is possible to avoid IP fragmentation in DNS by limiting
    the response size where possible and signaling the need to upgrade from UDP to
    TCP transport where necessary. This document describes techniques to avoid IP
    fragmentation in DNS.</p>"
