abstract:
- content: "<p>This document aims at simple, interoperable, and automated PKI management
    operations covering typical use cases of industrial and Internet of Things (IoT)
    scenarios. This is achieved by profiling the Certificate Management Protocol (CMP),
    the related Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF), and transfer based on HTTP
    or Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) in a succinct but sufficiently detailed
    and self-contained way. To make secure certificate management for simple scenarios
    and constrained devices as lightweight as possible, only the most crucial types
    of operations and options are specified as mandatory. More specialized or complex
    use cases are supported with optional features.</p>"
