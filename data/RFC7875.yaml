abstract:
- content: "<p>To ensure a baseline of interoperability between WebRTC endpoints,
    a minimum set of required codecs is specified. However, to maximize the possibility
    of establishing the session without the need for audio transcoding, it is also
    recommended to include in the offer other suitable audio codecs that are available
    to the browser.</p><p>This document provides some guidelines on the suitable codecs
    to be considered for WebRTC endpoints to address the use cases most relevant to
    interoperability.</p>"
