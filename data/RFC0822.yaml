abstract:
  content: This document revises the specifications in RFC 733, in order to serve
    the needs of the larger and more complex ARPA Internet.  Some of RFC 733's features
    failed to gain adequate acceptance.  In order to simplify the standard and the
    software that follows it, these features have been removed.  A different addressing
    scheme is used, to handle the case of internetwork mail; and the concept of re-transmission
    has been introduced.  Obsoletes RFC 733, NIC 41952.
