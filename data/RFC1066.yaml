abstract:
- content: "<p>This RFC provides the initial version of the Management Information
    Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets
    in the short-term. In particular, together with its companion memos which describe
    the structure of management information along with the initial network management
    protocol, these documents provide a simple, workable architecture and system for
    managing TCP/IP-based internets, and in particular, the Internet. This memo specifies
    a draft standard for the Internet community. TCP/IP implementations in the Internet
    which are network manageable are expected to adopt and implement this specification.</p>"
