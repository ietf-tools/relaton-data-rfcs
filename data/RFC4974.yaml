abstract:
- content: "<p>In certain networking topologies, it may be advantageous to maintain
    associations between endpoints and key transit points to support an instance of
    a service. Such associations are known as Calls.</p><p>A Call does not provide
    the actual connectivity for transmitting user traffic, but only builds a relationship
    by which subsequent Connections may be made. In Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) such
    Connections are known as Label Switched Paths (LSPs).</p><p>This document specifies
    how GMPLS Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling
    may be used and extended to support Calls. These mechanisms provide full and logical
    Call/Connection separation.</p><p>The mechanisms proposed in this document are
    applicable to any environment (including multi-area), and for any type of interface:
    packet, layer-2, time-division multiplexed, lambda, or fiber switching. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</p>"
