abstract:
- content: <p>New work is typically brought to the IETF by a group of interested individuals.
    IETF meetings are a convenient place for such groups to hold informal get-togethers
    to discuss and develop their ideas. Such side meetings, which are not reflected
    in the IETF meeting agenda and have no official status, are often half-jokingly
    referred to as "bar BOF" sessions to acknowledge that some of them may eventually
    lead to a proposal for an official IETF BOF ("birds of a feather" session) on
    a given topic.</p><p>During recent IETF meetings, many such "bar BOF" get-togethers
    have been organized and moderated in ways that made them increasingly indistinguishable
    from official IETF BOFs or sometimes even IETF working group meetings.</p><p>This
    document argues that this recent trend is not helpful in reaching the ultimate
    goal of many of these get-togethers, i.e., to efficiently discuss and develop
    ideas for new IETF work. It encourages the organizers to consider the benefits
    of holding them in much less formal settings and to also consider alternative
    means to develop their ideas. This document also recommends that the community
    abandon the term "bar BOF" and instead use other terms such as "side meeting",
    in order to stress the unofficial nature of these get-togethers. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>
