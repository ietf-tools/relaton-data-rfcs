abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a set of requirements for the establishment
    and maintenance of Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Traffic-Engineered (TE) Multiprotocol
    Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs).</p><p>There is no intent to
    specify solution-specific details or application-specific requirements in this
    document.</p><p>The requirements presented in this document not only apply to
    packet-switched networks under the control of MPLS protocols, but also encompass
    the requirements of Layer Two Switching (L2SC), Time Division Multiplexing (TDM),
    lambda, and port switching networks managed by Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) protocols.
    Protocol solutions developed to meet the requirements set out in this document
    must attempt to be equally applicable to MPLS and GMPLS. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>"
