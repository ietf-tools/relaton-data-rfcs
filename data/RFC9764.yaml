abstract:
- content: |-
    <p>The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol is commonly
    used to verify connectivity between two systems. BFD packets are
    typically very small. It is desirable in some circumstances to know
    not only that the path between two systems is reachable, but also
    that it is capable of carrying a payload of a particular size. This
    document specifies how to implement such a mechanism using BFD in
    Asynchronous mode.</p><p>YANG modules for managing this mechanism are also defined in this
    document. These YANG modules augment the existing BFD YANG modules
    defined in RFC 9314. The YANG modules in this document conform to the
    Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) (RFC 8342).</p>
