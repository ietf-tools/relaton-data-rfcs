abstract:
- content: "<p>DNS Cookies are a lightweight DNS transaction security mechanism that
    provides limited protection to DNS servers and clients against a variety of increasingly
    common denial-of-service and amplification/ forgery or cache poisoning attacks
    by off-path attackers. DNS Cookies are tolerant of NAT, NAT-PT (Network Address
    Translation - Protocol Translation), and anycast and can be incrementally deployed.
    (Since DNS Cookies are only returned to the IP address from which they were originally
    received, they cannot be used to generally track Internet users.)</p>"
