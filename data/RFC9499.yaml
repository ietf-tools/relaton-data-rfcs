abstract:
- content: <p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is defined in literally dozens of different
    RFCs. The terminology used by implementers and developers of DNS protocols, and
    by operators of DNS systems, has changed in the decades since the DNS was first
    defined. This document gives current definitions for many of the terms used in
    the DNS in a single document.</p><p>This document updates RFC 2308 by clarifying
    the definitions of "forwarder" and "QNAME". It obsoletes RFC 8499 by adding multiple
    terms and clarifications. Comprehensive lists of changed and new definitions can
    be found in Appendices A and B.</p>
