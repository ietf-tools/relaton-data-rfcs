abstract:
  content: RFC 4279 and RFC 4785 describe pre-shared key cipher suites for Transport
    Layer Security (TLS).  However, all those cipher suites use SHA-1 in their Message
    Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm.  This document describes a set of pre-shared
    key cipher suites for TLS that uses stronger digest algorithms (i.e., SHA-256
    or SHA-384) and another set that uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in
    Galois Counter Mode (GCM). [STANDARDS-TRACK]
