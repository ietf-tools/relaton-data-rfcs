abstract:
- content: <p>This memo discusses the utility of "subnets" of Internet networks, which
    are logically visible sub-sections of a single Internet network. For administrative
    or technical reasons, many organizations have chosen to divide one Internet network
    into several subnets, instead of acquiring a set of Internet network numbers.
    This memo specifies procedures for the use of subnets. These procedures are for
    hosts (e.g., workstations). The procedures used in and between subnet gateways
    are not fully described. Important motivation and background information for a
    subnetting standard is provided in RFC-940. This RFC specifies a protocol for
    the ARPA-Internet community. If subnetting is implemented it is strongly recommended
    that these procedures be followed.</p>
