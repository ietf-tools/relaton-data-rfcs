abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes a simple, interoperable mechanism that can
    be employed in Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) networks in
    order to decrease the data loss associated with deterministic blackholing of packets
    during transient network conditions. The mechanism proposed here requires no IS-IS
    protocol changes and is completely interoperable with the existing IS-IS specification.
    This memo provides information for the Internet community.</p>"
