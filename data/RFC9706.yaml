abstract:
- content: "<p>As Internet audience sizes for high-interest live events reach unprecedented
    levels and bitrates climb to support formats and applications such as 4K, 8K,
    and Augmented Reality (AR), live streaming can place a unique type of stress upon
    network resources. TreeDN is a tree-based Content Delivery Network (CDN) architecture
    designed to address the distinctive scaling challenges of live streaming to mass
    audiences. TreeDN enables operators to offer Replication-as-a-Service (RaaS) at
    a fraction of the cost of traditional, unicast-based CDNs -- in some cases, at
    no additional cost to the infrastructure. In addition to efficiently utilizing
    network resources to deliver existing multi-destination traffic, this architecture
    also enables new types of content and use cases that previously were not possible
    or economically viable using traditional CDN approaches. Finally, TreeDN is a
    decentralized architecture and a democratizing technology that makes content distribution
    more accessible to more people by dramatically reducing the costs of replication.</p>"
