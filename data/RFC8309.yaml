abstract:
- content: "<p>The IETF has produced many modules in the YANG modeling language. The
    majority of these modules are used to construct data models to model devices or
    monolithic functions.</p><p>A small number of YANG modules have been defined to
    model services (for example, the Layer 3 Virtual Private Network Service Model
    (L3SM) produced by the L3SM working group and documented in RFC 8049).</p><p>This
    document describes service models as used within the IETF and also shows where
    a service model might fit into a software-defined networking architecture. Note
    that service models do not make any assumption of how a service is actually engineered
    and delivered for a customer; details of how network protocols and devices are
    engineered to deliver a service are captured in other modules that are not exposed
    through the interface between the customer and the provider.</p>"
