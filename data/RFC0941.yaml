abstract:
- content: "<p>This Addendum to the Network Service Definition Standard, ISO 8348,
    defines the abstract syntax and semantics of the Network Address (Network Service
    Access Point Address). The Network Address defined in this Addendum is the address
    that appears in the primitives of the connection-mode Network Service as the calling
    address, called address, and responding address parameters, and in the primitives
    of the connectionless-mode Network Service as the source address and destination
    address parameters. This document is distributed as an RFC for information only.
    It does not specify a standard for the ARPA-Internet.</p>"
