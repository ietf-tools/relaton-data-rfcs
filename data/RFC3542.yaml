abstract:
- content: '<p>This document provides sockets Application Program Interface (API)
    to support "advanced" IPv6 applications, as a supplement to a separate specification,
    RFC 3493. The expected applications include Ping, Traceroute, routing daemons
    and the like, which typically use raw sockets to access IPv6 or ICMPv6 header
    fields. This document proposes some portable interfaces for applications that
    use raw sockets under IPv6. There are other features of IPv6 that some applications
    will need to access: interface identification (specifying the outgoing interface
    and determining the incoming interface), IPv6 extension headers, and path Maximum
    Transmission Unit (MTU) information. This document provides API access to these
    features too. Additionally, some extended interfaces to libraries for the "r"
    commands are defined. The extension will provide better backward compatibility
    to existing implementations that are not IPv6-capable. This memo provides information
    for the Internet community.</p>'
