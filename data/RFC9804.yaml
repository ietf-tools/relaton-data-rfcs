abstract:
- content: '<p>This memo specifies the data structure representation that was devised
    to support Simple Public Key Infrastructure (SPKI) certificates, as detailed in
    RFC 2692, with the intent that it be more widely applicable. It has been and is
    being used elsewhere. There are multiple implementations in a variety of programming
    languages. Uses of this representation are referred to in this document as "S-expressions".
    This memo makes precise the encodings of these SPKI S-expressions: It gives a
    "canonical form" for them, describes two "transport" representations, and also
    describes an "advanced" format for display to people.</p>'
