abstract:
- content: "<p>As networked devices become smaller, more portable, and more ubiquitous,
    the ability to operate with less configured infrastructure is increasingly important.
    In particular, the ability to look up DNS resource record data types (including,
    but not limited to, host names) in the absence of a conventional managed DNS server
    is useful.</p><p>Multicast DNS (mDNS) provides the ability to perform DNS-like
    operations on the local link in the absence of any conventional Unicast DNS server.
    In addition, Multicast DNS designates a portion of the DNS namespace to be free
    for local use, without the need to pay any annual fee, and without the need to
    set up delegations or otherwise configure a conventional DNS server to answer
    for those names.</p><p>The primary benefits of Multicast DNS names are that (i)
    they require little or no administration or configuration to set them up, (ii)
    they work when no infrastructure is present, and (iii) they work during infrastructure
    failures.</p>"
