abstract:
- content: "<p>The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a framework for structuring
    data.  While it evolved from Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) -- a
    markup language primarily focused on structuring documents -- XML has evolved
    to be a widely-used mechanism for representing structured data.  There are a wide
    variety of Internet protocols being developed; many have need for a representation
    for structured data relevant to their application.  There has been much interest
    in the use of XML as a representation method.  This document describes basic XML
    concepts, analyzes various alternatives in the use of XML, and provides guidelines
    for the use of XML within IETF standards-track protocols.  This document specifies
    an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion
    and suggestions for improvements.</p>"
