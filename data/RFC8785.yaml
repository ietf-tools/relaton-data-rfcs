abstract:
- content: <p>Cryptographic operations like hashing and signing need the data to be
    expressed in an invariant format so that the operations are reliably repeatable.
    One way to address this is to create a canonical representation of the data. Canonicalization
    also permits data to be exchanged in its original form on the "wire" while cryptographic
    operations performed on the canonicalized counterpart of the data in the producer
    and consumer endpoints generate consistent results.</p><p>This document describes
    the JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS). This specification defines how to create
    a canonical representation of JSON data by building on the strict serialization
    methods for JSON primitives defined by ECMAScript, constraining JSON data to the
    Internet JSON (I-JSON) subset, and by using deterministic property sorting.</p>
