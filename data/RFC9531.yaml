abstract:
- content: <p>Path steering is a mechanism to discover paths to the producers of Information-Centric
    Networking (ICN) Content Objects and steer subsequent Interest messages along
    a previously discovered path. It has various uses, including the operation of
    state-of-the-art multi-path congestion control algorithms and for network measurement
    and management. This specification derives directly from the design published
    in "Path Switching in Content Centric and Named Data Networks" (4th ACM Conference
    on Information-Centric Networking) and, therefore, does not recapitulate the design
    motivations, implementation details, or evaluation of the scheme. However, some
    technical details are different, and where there are differences, the design documented
    here is to be considered definitive.</p><p>This document is a product of the IRTF
    Information-Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG). It is not an IETF product
    and is not an Internet Standard.</p>
