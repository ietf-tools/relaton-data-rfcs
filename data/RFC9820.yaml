abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies an authentication service that uses the Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP) as a transport method to carry the Extensible Authentication
    Protocol (EAP). As such, it defines an EAP lower layer based on CoAP called "CoAP-EAP".
    One of the main goals is to authenticate a CoAP-enabled Internet of Things (IoT)
    device (EAP peer) that intends to join a security domain managed by a Controller
    (EAP authenticator). Secondly, it allows deriving key material to protect CoAP
    messages exchanged between them based on Object Security for Constrained RESTful
    Environments (OSCORE), enabling the establishment of a security association between
    them.</p>
