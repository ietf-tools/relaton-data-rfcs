abstract:
- content: <p>Many protocols must detect packet loss for various reasons (e.g., to
    ensure reliability using retransmissions or to understand the level of congestion
    along a network path).  While many mechanisms have been designed to detect loss,
    ultimately, protocols can only count on the passage of time without delivery confirmation
    to declare a packet "lost".  Each implementation of a time-based loss detection
    mechanism represents a balance between correctness and timeliness; therefore,
    no implementation suits all situations.  This document provides high-level requirements
    for time-based loss detectors appropriate for general use in unicast communication
    across the Internet.  Within the requirements, implementations have latitude to
    define particulars that best address each situation.</p>
