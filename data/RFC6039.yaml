abstract:
- content: "<p>Routing protocols have been extended over time to use cryptographic
    mechanisms to ensure that data received from a neighboring router has not been
    modified in transit and actually originated from an authorized neighboring router.</p><p>The
    cryptographic mechanisms defined to date and described in this document rely on
    a digest produced with a hash algorithm applied to the payload encapsulated in
    the routing protocol packet.</p><p>This document outlines some of the limitations
    of the current mechanism, problems with manual keying of these cryptographic algorithms,
    and possible vectors for the exploitation of these limitations. This document
    is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational
    purposes.</p>"
