abstract:
- content: "<p>This document presents a technique for using a Markdown syntax variant,
    called Pandoc, and a bit of XML (as defined in RFC 2629) as a source format for
    documents that are Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) or RFCs.</p><p>The goal of this technique
    (which is called Pandoc2rfc) is to let an author of an I-D focus on the main body
    of text without being distracted too much by XML tags; however, it does not alleviate
    the need to typeset some files in XML.</p>"
