abstract:
- content: "<p>This Protocol Standard is one of a set of International Standards produced
    to facilitate the interconnection of open systems. The set of standards covers
    the services and protocols required to achieve such interconnection. This Protocol
    Standard is positioned with respect to other related standards by the layers defined
    in the Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnection (ISO 7498). In particular,
    it is a protocol of the Network Layer. This Protocol may be used between network-entities
    in end systems or in Network Layer relay systems (or both). It provides the Connectionless-mode
    Network Service as defined in Addendum 1 to the Network Service Definition Covering
    Connectionless-mode Transmission (ISO 8348/AD1).</p>"
